# Dee Store
This is a simple online shopping web application that I developed for an assignment of the bachelor's degree. For the front-end, a HTML + CSS template has been used while the backend has been developed using PHP, MYSQL, AJAX, jQuery, Python &amp; etc. This web application contains a simple chatbot created using JS and image search feature. Sharing this for the purpose of beginners to use this as reference to work on their own projects...<br>


## Features
+ Shopping cart
+ Checkout order
+ Dummy payment interface
+ Product listing
+ Simple chatbot (JS based)
+ Product search using keywords
+ Product search using images (Python based. Need to run the python app inside the Python directory)
+ Order status
+ Login/Logout
+ Admin dashboard
+ Order listing (admin)
+ Complete orders (admin)


## Important
+ Create a database named 'dee_store' and import the .sql file in 'database .sql file' folder.<br>
+ Run the Python backend application (Read the README.txt file inside the 'python' folder)<br>
+ The codebase hasn't been enhanced for the best perfomance and there can be unwanted or inefficient parts in the code as this was done many years back.<br>
