# dee-shop.github.io
This is a simple online shopping web application that I developed for an assignment of the bachelor's degree. For the front-end, a HTML + CSS template has been used while the backend has been developed using PHP, MYSQL, AJAX, jQuery &amp; etc. Sharing this for the purpose of beginners to use this as reference to work on their own projects...
