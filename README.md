# Dee Store
This is a simple online shopping web application that I developed for an assignment of the bachelor's degree. For the front-end, a HTML + CSS template has been used while the backend has been developed using PHP, MYSQL, AJAX, jQuery &amp; etc. Sharing this for the purpose of beginners to use this as reference to work on their own projects...

+ Create a database named 'dee_store' and import the .sql file in 'database .sql file' folder.
+ Run the Python backend application (Read the README.txt file inside the 'python' folder)
+ The codebase hasn't been enhanced for the best perfomance and hasn't been well optimized as this was done many years back.
